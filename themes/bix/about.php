						<span>“ This book happened because my co-author, Anika Martins, said to me, “Have you written your book yet?” and I said to her “No, I need someone to say my book to.” She said, “Let’s go.” We began our conversations in coffee shops, Thai restaurants, Skype and by phone. With her generosity, she listened and formed conversations into these stories. I can’t thank her enough. “</span>

						<h3>Why I'm Here</h3>
						<p>
							<span>I have been preparing for this conversation for over 70 years.</span>
							<span>My life has been a journey dedicated to understanding and attempting to discover a pathway to resolve the over-arching dilemmas individuals and organizations face in today’s world. We all know the old answers will no longer work. </span>
							<span>But where do we look for new answers?</span>
							<span>This has been my quest.</span>

						<h3>The world has changed.</h3>
						<p>
							<span>The only resource not subject to diminishing returns is knowledge. It is the creation of knowledge that will provide an organization with continued success. Our ability to learn – <strong>learning to learn</strong> – is the most needed transformation in ourselves and in our organizations if we are going to successfully meet the challenges of the global marketplace.</span>
